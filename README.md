This Script is for Everyone who wants to transfer a Spotify playlist to youtube, 
alot of friends told me 

A Python script that is able to Read Spotify Playlists and Create new Youtube Playlists

You need a client_secrets.json from the Youtube API and the Spotify Client ID and secrec;


it currently works but just with smaller Playlists, up to 60 songs, and only once a day as it still is a Test project and the Test Credits are onlly 10.000 you will need 1100 quotas for 7 songs
